Today，,early,in,the,morning，,when,I,woke,up，,I,found,it,was,later,for,half,an,hour,than,I,usually,did。,Then,I,remembered,that,I,didn’t,set,up,the,morning,call,last,night。,So,I,just,grabbed,some,bread,and,rushed,to,the,bus,station。,The,bus,seemed,always,not,appearing,when,I,needed,it。,Finally，,I,took,on,a,bus，,then,I,felt,so,relieved，,because,I,wouldn’t,be,late,for,school。,Suddenly，,the,bus,stopped,and,the,driver,told,us,to,change,another,bus，,because,there,was,something,wrong,with,the,wheels。,I,was,so,worried。,When,I,arrived,school，,I,was,late。,It,was,such,a,bad,day,for,me。
